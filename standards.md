| | Be able to use Big-O to characterize the running time of a function or algorithm |
| *Experimental* |  Know how to do basic profiling experiments by timing code on a variety of inputs |
| | Understand the limitations of experimental studies.
| *General* | Compare and contrasts the role and value of Big-O analysis and experimental analysis when considering the performance of a program, function, or algorithm. |
| **Programming** |  |
| *Conditionals* | Have some proficiency with the use of branching if..elif..else conditional statements. Know when to use them and how to write them. |
| | Understand and make use of boolean operators not, and, or when expressing conditionals. |
| | Be able to design and implement predicate functions for use in conditionals |
| *Loops and Iteration* | Be able to traverse through lists and arrays by value and by index. Know when to use the two approaches and how to write the corresponding loops. |
| | Understand and recognize when by-index traversal is necessary |
| | Know when to use iteration and accumulation to solve problems and know how to program them with loops. |
| *Functions* | Know the difference between functions and operations that return values and those that modify or mutate objects. Know how to use both. |
| | Have proficiency with the design, implementation, and testing of functions that return values, functions that modify one or more arguments, and functions that produce I/O effects.
| *Recursion* | Understand how a recursive function works and how to analyze its running time. |
| | Know how to implement a recursive function with extra attention on identifying non-recursive base cases versus the recursive cases |

| **Abstract Data Types** | Understand and explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types |
| | Understand how to interpret and produce an abstract, behavioral specification of a data type through constructors, accessors, mutators, and other key functionality. |
| | Understand the use of classes and Object-Oriented Programming to implement ADTs while hiding the underlying implementation details. |
| | Be able to use Big-O to characterize the runtime cost of using ADTs |

| | Know how to work with Interactive Consoles, when available, for the purpose of analyzing and debugging code. |
| | Understand the uses and limits of testing when addressing the correctness of a program |
| *Program UI* | Know how to write and design a program with a basic command-line interface |
|  | Know how to read and write to files and in particular the use of structured file formats like Comma separated values (CSV) |
| | Know how to carry out basic interactive I/O sequences as part of a program's UI. |
| **Python** | |
